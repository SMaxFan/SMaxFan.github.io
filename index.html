	I am an A.B. candidate at Harvard College, with double majors in Pure Mathematics and English Literature. On the English side, I work on most things post-1600, with special focus on literary modernism, post colonial theory, and queer theory. On the Mathematics side, I enjoy competition mathematics but have little appetite for research. My coursework includes organic chemistry, architecture, and economics. Currently, my research focuses on Grace Paley and J. R. Ackerley&mdash;the former for a biography, the latter for my thesis. In my spare time, enjoy hiking and fishing on the Australian coastline. I play badminton well and tennis enthusiastically. Some time ago, I was the captain of the Australian Debate Team and worked as a political speech writer.

	I am on the job market for post-graduation teaching jobs. I am 22 and an Australian citizen.
